# timetable_checker python3 program
# My name is Tonny Wanjala Mulati. I live in Kenya. Am passionate about coding.
# I am the creator of the timetable_checker program.
# It helps teachers to check their current lessons at any given time of the day. They do that by just entering the current day's name, eg.Monday
# The program  instantly outputs the current class names-subject names-teachers' names.
# This is my first coding project in python3.
# Glory be to God!
